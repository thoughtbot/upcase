== 1.16.2 / 2010-04-06
* Bugfix in Trollop::options. Thanks to Brian C. Thomas for pointing it out.

== 1.16.1 / 2010-04-05
* Bugfix in Trollop::die method introduced in last release.

== 1.16 / 2010-04-01
* Add Trollop::with_standard_exception_handling method for easing the use of Parser directly.
* Handle scientific notation in float arguments, thanks to Will Fitzgerald.
* Drop hoe dependency.

== 1.15 / 2009-09-30
* Don't raise an exception when out of short arguments (thanks to Rafael
  Sevilla for pointing out how dumb this behavior was).

== 1.14 / 2009-06-19
* Make :multi arguments default to [], not nil, when not set on the commandline.
* Minor commenting and error message improvements

== 1.13 / 2009-03-16
* Fix parsing of "--longarg=<value with spaces>".

== 1.12 / 2009-01-30
* Fix some unit test failures in the last release. Should be more careful.
* Make default short options only be assigned *after* all user-specified
  short options. Now there's a little less juggling to do when you just
  want to specify a few short options.

== 1.11 / 2009-01-29
* Set <opt>_given keys in the results hash for options that were specified
  on the commandline.

== 1.10.2 / 2008-10-23
* No longer try `stty size` for screen size detection. Just use curses, and
  screen users will have to deal with the screen clearing.

== 1.10.1 / 2008-10-22
* Options hash now responds to method calls as well as standard hash lookup.
* Default values for multi-occurrence parameters now autoboxed.
* The relationship between multi-value, multi-occurrence, and default values
  improved and explained.
* Documentation improvements.

== 1.10 / 2008-10-21
* Added :io type for parameters that point to IO streams (filenames, URIs, etc).
* For screen size detection, first try `stty size` before loading Curses.
* Improved documentation.

== 1.9 / 2008-08-20
* Added 'stop_on_unknown' command to stop parsing on any unknown argument.
  This is useful for handling sub-commands when you don't know the entire
  set of commands up front. (E.g. if the initial arguments can change it.)
* Added a :multi option for parameters, signifying that they can be specified
  multiple times.
* Added :ints, :strings, :doubles, and :floats option types, which can take
  multiple arguments.

== 1.8.2 / 2008-06-25
* Bugfix for #conflicts and #depends error messages

== 1.8.1 / 2008-06-24
* Bugfix for short option autocreation
* More aggressive documentation

== 1.8 / 2008-06-16
* Sub-command support via Parser#stop_on

== 1.7.2 / 2008-01-16
* Ruby 1.9-ify. Apparently this means replacing :'s with ;'s.

== 1.7.1 / 2008-01-07
* Documentation improvements

== 1.7 / 2007-06-17
* Fix incorrect error message for multiple missing required arguments
  (thanks to Neill Zero)

== 1.6 / 2007-04-01
* Don't attempt curses screen-width magic unless running on a terminal.

== 1.5 / 2007-03-31
* --help and --version do the right thing even if the rest of the
  command line is incorrect.
* Added #conflicts and #depends to model dependencies and exclusivity
  between arguments.
* Minor bugfixes.

== 1.4 / 2007-03-26
* Disable short options with :short => :none.
* Minor bugfixes and error message improvements.

== 1.3 / 2007-01-31
* Wrap at (screen width - 1) instead of screen width.
* User can override --help and --version.
* Bugfix in handling of -v and -h.
* More tests to confirm the above.

== 1.2 / 2007-01-31
* Minor documentation tweaks.
* Removed hoe dependency.

== 1.1 / 2007-01-30
* Trollop::options now passes any arguments as block arguments. Since
  instance variables are not properly captured by the block, this
  makes it slightly less noisy to pass them in as local variables.
  (A real-life use for _why's cloaker!)
* Help display now preserves original argument order.
* Trollop::die now also has a single string form in case death is not
  due to a single argument.
* Parser#text now an alias for Parser#banner, and can be called
  multiple times, with the output being placed in the right position
  in the help text.
* Slightly more indicative formatting for parameterized arguments.

== 1.0 / 2007-01-29
* Initial release.
