== Rails 3 usage

Include the git repository in your Gemfile:

    gem 'capybara-envjs-fixes', :git => "git://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-envjs-fixes.git"

Then, require the fixes from within cucumber:

    $ cat features/support/capybara_envjs_fixes.rb 
    require 'capybara_envjs_fixes/cucumber_fixes'

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
