## Anatomy of a Trail/Course

### 1. Introduction

- Briefly state what the learner will walk away with
- Set context: Where does this fit in their journey?
- Mention any prerequisites or key values (accessibility, AI ethics, etc.)

### 2. Conceptual Overview

- Define the main idea
- Show why it matters with examples or analogies
- Explain any key terms or assumptions

### 3. Demonstration / Walkthrough

- Show how the concept is applied in real life
- Be clear about where you're starting from (e.g., a scaffolded Rails app, a design sketch, etc.)
- Narrate why you're doing things, not just how

*Try to highlight both the “happy path” and potential tricky edge cases.*

### 4. Check What You’ve Learned

- Include a mini recap
- Ask reflection questions or small exercises:
  - What would you try differently?
  - Can you explain this to a coworker?
  - Where could this go wrong?

### 5. Wrap-Up + What’s Next

- Recap the key takeaways
- Suggest one or two next steps (deeper learning, building a feature)
- Link to any resources

## Tips for Writing or Recording
