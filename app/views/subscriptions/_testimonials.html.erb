        <p><strong>I was a 1-on-1 coaching subscriber – now I work at thoughtbot.</strong> My experience with Learn was amazing. I had a mentor who was aware of my proficiency and gave expert advice on how to move forward building my skills. Without doubt, Learn was vital to my professional growth and led to an apprenticeship at thoughtbot.</p>

          <p><strong>Learn gave me wings – I feel like I'm learning to fly.</strong>  I never thought I could aspire to a career in Programming. I expected it to be difficult, and didn't even own a computer until a couple of years ago. Learn provided the foundation for my future.</p>

          <p><strong>Learn is very useful</strong> – in particular the material I've been using to improve my testing (…and, you know, actually use TDD) has been excellent.</p>
