Hi <%= @user.first_name %>, 

First off, thanks for subscribing to Prime! We're glad to have you.

Secondly, I wanted to introduce myself. My name is <%= @mentor.name %> and I'll
be your mentor!

I'd like to set up a 30-minute Skype session right now so we can discuss your
goals and answer any initial questions you have.

You can access a read-only view of my calendar here:
https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=<%=u @mentor.email %>&mode=week.

To schedule a session, please send me an invite from your favorite calendar
tool. As long as that slot is open, I'll accept your request. I'm generally
available from 10:30am to 5pm US Eastern.

Please also include your Skype handle in your scheduling request.

Before our first call, I recommend you visit our Trail Maps to perform a
self-assessment of your skills: <%= topics_url %>

If you have anything you'd like to share before our call, just hit 'Reply' and
lay it on me.

Thanks again,
-<%= @mentor.first_name %>
