Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

First off, thanks for subscribing to <%= t('shared.subscription.name') %>!  We're glad to have you.

Secondly, I wanted to introduce myself. My name is <%= @mentor.name %> and I'll be your mentor. I'm excited to work with you!

Before our first call, please do the following:

1. Send me some background on yourself and your goals for working together. Who are you? What are you doing now? What do you want to do?

2. Add me to any repositories you'd like to work on together, or code you think represents where you're currently at as a developer. I'll take a look to get a better sense of your current experience level, and provide feedback. My github username is <%= @mentor.github_username %>.

3. Send me an invitation for a monthly, recurring 30-minute Skype session using your favorite scheduling program. As long as you've picked a time where I'm free, I'll accept. You can view my calendar here: https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=<%=u @mentor.email %>&mode=week. I'm generally available <%= @mentor.availability %>. Please include your Skype handle in your scheduling request.

4. Prepare some questions for our call. How can I help you?

Talk soon!

- <%= @mentor.first_name %>
