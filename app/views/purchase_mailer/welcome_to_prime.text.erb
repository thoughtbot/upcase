Hi <%= @user.first_name %>, 

First off, thanks for subscribing to Prime! We're glad to have you.

Secondly, I wanted to introduce myself. My name is <%= @mentor.name %> and I'll
be your mentor!

I'd like to set up a 30-minute Skype session right now so we can discuss your
goals.

You can view my calendar here: 
https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=<%=u @mentor.email %>.
Please feel free to suggest a 30 minute time which works for both of us and
we'll set it as a recurring event every other week. I'm generally available
from 9:30am to 5pm US Eastern. Please include your Skype handle in your
scheduling request.

Before our first call, I recommend you visit our Trail Maps to perform a
self-assessment of your skills: <%= topics_url %>

During these sessions, we'll discuss whatever you like: code review of
something you're working on, tips for getting hired for your first Rails job,
salary negotiation advice, whatever. My job is to be your guide to improving as
a developer.

If you have anything you'd like to share before our call, just hit 'Reply' and
lay it on me.

Thanks again,
-<%= @mentor.first_name %>
