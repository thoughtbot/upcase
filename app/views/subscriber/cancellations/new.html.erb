    <h2>Pause your subscription</h2>

    <p>
      Too busy to study right now? Pausing that Ruby project? Money a
      little tight?
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a little time away from Upcase we can pause your subscription
      for 3 months. You won't be charged again during this period.
    </p>

    <p>
      Progress on your exercises, trail progress, forum posts, etc, will be
      saved.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll email you 2 days before we restart your subscription to
      make sure you're ready.
    </p>
