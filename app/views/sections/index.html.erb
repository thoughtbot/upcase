      <q>Cannot recommend [Design for Developers] more. It&rsquo;s amazing and I have a totally different outlook on design and web development.</q>

      <q>Having taken a Thoughtbot training class on my own dime I can say it&rsquo;s 110% worth it. If you can hook it up, do it.</q>

      <q>As an alumnus of [Design for Developers], let me heartily recommend it to other devs who want to develop a better eye for design and learn the basics of implementing visually pleasing sites.</q>

<!-- <h4 id="why-we-rule">
  We believe the best learning occurs during hands-on, intimate time with passionate experts. Our workshops never have more than a 5-to-1 student-teacher ratio. They are short lectures followed by long pair programming sessions where students develop a real Rails app.
