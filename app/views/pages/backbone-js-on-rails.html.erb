          <dt><p>Deliver functionality on the client side for lightning fast applications and native app-like usability.</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Your customers use your app day-in and day-out: are they switching to the competition because your app is clunky, with full page refreshess and poor interactivity?  Push business logic into the browser and make your app crazy snappy.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>Faster, more interactive web apps &mdash; even on mobile!</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Create mobile apps that load blazing fast: Backbone.js and its dependencies are super tiny.  Learn how to choose the right dependencies and shed even more KBs.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>Rich client-side interactivity doesn't have to mean messy code.</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Is your JavaScript-heavy web app getting out of control?  Technical debt everywhere?  Are you using the DOM for persistence, and going crazy with layers and layers of jQuery form-parsing and ajax-submitting code?  Clean up your client-side code by following conventions, using software patterns you're familiar with, and refactoring to reusable modules.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>What should I know before reading?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>We assume that you are comfortable with JavaScript and have read the introductory Backbone.js material available online.  Not there yet?  We provide our favorite resources for getting up to speed in the book.</p></dd>
