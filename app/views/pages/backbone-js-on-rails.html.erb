        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Read a free sample from the book: <a style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;" href="http://ui.thoughtbot.com/assets/backbone-js-on-rails-thoughtbot-ebook-august-2011-sample.html">HTML</a> | <a style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;" href="http://ui.thoughtbot.com/assets/backbone-js-on-rails-thoughtbot-ebook-august-2011-sample.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
        <p>
          You build web apps, and you've seen the shift towards highly interactive, rich client-side web applications.  Over the past years, we've seen the same things, and have built our apps, processes, and best practices around this.  Learn the better way to build rich, interactive applications using Backbone.js and Rails.
        </p>

        <h3>It's more than your average eBook</h3>
        <p>
          We're writing an eBook that covers intermediate to advanced topics on using Backbone.js, including content specific to integrating with Rails applications. We're writing it using <a href="https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe">git-scribe</a>, committing the book into GitHub, and giving you access from day one.  This isn't a finished book yet &ndash; but that's the best part! You get full access to the GitHub repository as we write, so you'll use the GitHub comment and issue features to give us feedback about what we've written and what you'd like to see.  Give us your toughest Backbone.js questions, and we'll see what we can do. Last but not least, also included is a complete sample Backbone.js and Rails application. What the book describes and explains, the example app demonstrates with real, working code. Fully up to date for Rails 3.1.

          <dd><p>Your customers use your app day-in and day-out: are they switching to the competition because your app is clunky, with full page refreshess and poor interactivity?  Push business logic into the browser and make your app crazy snappy.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>Build faster, more interactive web apps &mdash; even on mobile!</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Create mobile apps that load blazing fast: Backbone.js and its dependencies are super tiny.  Learn how to choose the right dependencies and shed even more KBs.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>Do it all without compromising and writing messy, disorganized code.</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Is your JavaScript-heavy web app getting out of control?  Technical debt everywhere?  Are you using the DOM for persistence, and going crazy with layers and layers of jQuery form-parsing and ajax-submitting code?  Clean up your client-side code by following conventions, using software patterns you're familiar with, and refactoring to reusable modules.</p></dd>
