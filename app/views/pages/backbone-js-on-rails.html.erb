        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Read a free sample from the book: <a style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;" href="http://ui.thoughtbot.com/assets/backbone-js-on-rails-thoughtbot-ebook-august-2011-sample.html">HTML</a> | <a style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;" href="http://ui.thoughtbot.com/assets/backbone-js-on-rails-thoughtbot-ebook-august-2011-sample.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
        <p>
          You build web apps, and you've seen the shift towards highly interactive, rich client-side web applications.  Over the past years, we've seen the same things, and have built our apps, processes, and best practices around this.  Learn the better way to build rich, interactive applications using Backbone.js and Rails.
        </p>

        <h3>More than just a book</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the book, you also get a complete example application, and the ability to get your questions about Backbone.js and Rails answered by the thoughtbot team. The book is written using <a href="https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe">git-scribe</a> on GitHub. When you purchase, we give you access directly to the repository, so you can use the GitHub comment and issue features to give us feedback about what we've written and what you'd like to see. Give us your toughest Backbone.js questions with GitHub issues, and we'll answer. Last but not least, also included is a complete sample Backbone.js and Rails application. What the book describes and explains, the example app demonstrates with real, working code. Fully up to date for Rails 3.1 and Backbone 0.9.1.

          <dt><p>How is the content delivered?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>We're writing the book on GitHub and you'll get access to the repository &ndash; you get updates the second we push them.</p><p>We are writing the content using <a href="https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe">git-scribe</a>, which provides a publishing pipeline for HTML, PDF, ePub (iBooks, Nook), and Mobi (Kindle).  We're supporting HTML out of the gate, and other formats as soon as they're ready to go down smooth.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>What should I know before reading?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>We assume that you are comfortable with JavaScript and have read the introductory Backbone.js material available online.  Not there yet?  We provide our favorite resources for getting up to speed in the book.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>I have a specific burning question!  What if it doesn't cover my favorite topic?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>One of our goals with this delivery format is to encourage you to give feedback as early in the process as possible.  Use the rocking GitHub workflow tools to comment on the book or request new content.</p></dd>
          <dt><p>Do you offer a student discount?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>We price the book fairly for the work we put into it and the support costs involved, at a price that is less than most school textbooks. And it includes not only the book and source code, but the ability to get your questions answered by us about Backbone.js and Rails. So we do not offer student discounts.</p></dd>
