    <h3>Don't get stuck</h3>

    <p>
      The most important thing for your learning is that you <strong>never get
        stuck</strong>. Stuck sucks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stuck could mean you're having trouble completing an exercise. Or maybe
      you don't know what to study next.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Do not stay stuck. Ask for help.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Every page has a question mark in the bottom right hand corner. Use it
      liberally. We're here to help.

    <h3>The Weekly Iteration</h3>

    <p>
      <%= link_to "The Weekly Iteration", show_path("the-weekly-iteration") %>
      comes out every Tuesday (we'll email you!). It's a 10-20 minute show
      hosted by thoughtbot designers and developers.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h3>Trails</h3>

    <p>
      <%= link_to "Trails", trail_path("tmux") %> are the perfect thing to
      tackle on a Saturday or a wide-open evening when you're ready to write
      some code or watch longer videos.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some trails consist of videos, like our tmux trail. Others use our
      <strong>exercise system</strong>. In those, you'll clone down a Git
      repo and <strong>write code on your own machine</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, once your solution is complete, you'll <strong>push to our Git
      server</strong> and <strong>see thoughtbot's featured solution</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Start Now</h3>

    <p>
      Remember: <strong>the most important thing is to try something.</strong>
      Use the question mark in the bottom right if you feel like you don't know
      where to start.
