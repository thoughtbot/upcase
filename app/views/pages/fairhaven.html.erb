          <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> is running two special training courses: "Intro to Rails" on March 3rd and 4th and "Scaling Rails" on March 31st and April 1st.
        </p>
        <h3>Special Price: $600 (a 50% discount)</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of the usual $1,256 price tag, these classes are only $600 each. <a href="http://fairhavencapital.com">Fairhaven Capital</a> is sponsoring these classes to help grow the pool of Rails talent in the Boston area. While we will try to accommodate all requests, we will first admit developers at local startups or those looking to work at local startups.
        </p>
        <h3>Course Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Our goal is to teach Rails, an increasingly popular technology choice by web startups, to Boston-area developers with a background in Java, .NET, PHP, or other web technologies. We believe each course will accelerate developers about two months up the learning curve towards expert.

            <h5>March 3rd &amp; 4th</h5>

            <p>
              "Intro to Rails" is a primer on the Ruby language, a primer on testing with Ruby, and then a hands-on workshop where students create and deploy a Rails application. You'll learn all the major components of Rails and how they practically fit together, including all the best practices in use at thoughtbot on our projects.

              "Scaling Rails" goes deeper into Test-Driven Development with Rails, covers all the "software hygiene" practices specific to Rails that enable teams to move fast, and applying well-known web scaling knowledge such as caching, database indexing, and technical architecture to Rails apps.
