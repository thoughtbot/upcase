          <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> is running two special training courses: "Intro to Rails" on March 3rd and 4th and "Scaling Rails" on March 31st and April 1st.
        </p>
        <h3>$600 (more than a 50% discount)</h3>
        <p>
          These classes are special because instead of the usual $1,256 price tag, they are only $600. <a href="http://fairhavencapial.com">Fairhaven Capital</a> is generously sponsoring these events, bringing the price down. Each class is limited to 25 students.
        </p>
        <h3>The goal</h3>
        <p>
          Working together, our goal is to teach Rails, an increasingly popular choice by web startups, to Boston-area developers with a background in Java/.NET/PHP/etc. We believe each course will accelerate developers about two months down the learning curve.
        </p>

            <h4>Intro to Rails</h4>
            <h5>March 3rd &amp;4th</h5>
            <p>
"Intro to Rails" is a primer on the Ruby language, a primer on testing with Ruby, and then a hands-on workshop where students create and deploy a Rails application. You'll learn all the major components of Rails and how they practically fit together, including all the best practices in use at thoughtbot on our projects.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Scaling Rails</h4>
            <h5>March 31st &amp; April 1st</h5>
            <p>
"Scaling Rails" goes deeper into Test-Driven Development with Rails, covers all the "software hygiene" practices specific to Rails that enable teams to move fast, and applying well-known web scaling knowledge such as caching, database indexing, and technical architecture to Rails apps.
