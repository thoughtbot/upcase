    <h1>Backbone.js on Rails</h1>
    <p>We're writing an eBook that covers intermediate to advanced topics on using Backbone.js. The book is still in progress â€“ but that's the best part! You get full access to the GitHub repository as we write. In addition to the book, your purchase gets you access to a complete example application, all future updates to the book and example app, and the ability to ask us questions and receive Rails and Backbone.js support via GitHub issues.</p>
