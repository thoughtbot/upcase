            Since 2012, one way we’ve shared thoughtbot expertise is through the
            learning platform you find yourself on today - Upcase. With Upcase,
            we’ve helped thousands of developers level up their skills through
            workshops, videos, flash cards, and coding exercises.

    <div class="about-us__history">
      <p>
        While mentoring client teams, we identified a lack of educational content
        for intermediate developers. We decided to to fill that gap ourselves with
        Upcase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of the Upcase platform is <mark>hundreds of hours of videos and
        screencasts</mark>, neatly organized into courses and by topic so that
        you can find exactly what you need and get to learning.
