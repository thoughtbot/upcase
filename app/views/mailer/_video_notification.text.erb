Hello,

<% if video.has_notes? %>

<% end %>
You can get to the lesson in two ways:

* By following the link in your receipt email
* By going to the "My Account" page on http://learn.thoughtbot.com, and clicking on "<%= video.watchable.name %>" in the right hand sidebar. If you do not have a user account at Learn yet, create one with the same email address you used to register for the workshop and the purchase of the workshop should be linked to your account. Or create it with a different email or github account and let us know and we'll manually associate it.

thank you very much,
