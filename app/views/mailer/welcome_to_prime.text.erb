Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

I wanted to personally reach out to you and thank you for subscribing to Learn
Prime.

If you haven't already, I recommend you visit our Trail Maps to check off the
skills you already have and discover which workshops are right for you:
<%= topics_path %>

I'd also love to learn more about who you are, what your experience level is,
and what your goals are for Prime. Just hit 'Reply' and lay it on me.

We can even schedule a skype or phone call to discuss your goals and your
current level and how you might progress. You can view my calendar here:
http://calendar.chadpytel.com. Please feel free to suggest a 30 minute time
which works for both of us.

Thanks again,
Chad
