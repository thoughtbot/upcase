      | Test-Driven Haskell  | short description |
      | Test-Driven Assembly | mov AL, 61h       |
    And the following section exists:
      | id   | course                    | starts on     | ends on       |
      | 1234 | name: Test-Driven Haskell | June 13, 2010 | June 16, 2010 |
    When I go to the home page
    Then I see "Test-Driven Haskell" is scheduled from "June 13, 2010" to "June 16, 2010"
    And I should see "short description"

  Scenario: Scheduled Courses Appear in Order

    #Then I should see "Web Developer" before "Product Manager"
    And I should see "Test-Driven Haskell" before "Test-Driven Erlang"
    And I should see "Test-Driven Erlang" before "Test-Driven Go"
