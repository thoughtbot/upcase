  Scenario: Request a follow up with no scheduled section
    Given today is June 17, 2010
    And the following course exists:
      | name                |
      | Test-Driven Haskell |
    And the following section exists:
      | id   | course                    | starts on     | ends on       |
      | 1234 | name: Test-Driven Haskell | June 13, 2010 | June 16, 2010 |
    When I go to the home page
    When I follow "Test-Driven Haskell"
    And I fill in "follow_up_email" with "foo@example.com"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "We will contact you when we schedule Test-Driven Haskell."
    And KISSmetrics receives the "Requested Followup" event with:
      | Course Name | Test-Driven Haskell |
    And I should be on the home page
    When the following section exists:
      | id   | course                    | starts on     | ends on       |
      | 1235 | name: Test-Driven Haskell | July 17, 2010 | July 18, 2010 |
    Then "foo@example.com" receives a follow up email for "Test-Driven Haskell"
