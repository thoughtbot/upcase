Feature: Selecting a course and registering for it

  Scenario: No courses
    When I go to the home page
    Then I see the empty section description

  Scenario: User registers for a section then is signed in
    Given today is June 10, 2010
    And I am signed in as an admin
    And I create the following course:
      | Course Name        | Test-Driven Haskell |
      | Short description  | Short description   |
      | Course Description | It is great!        |
      | Price              | 10000000            |
      | Location Address   | 123 Main St.        |
      | Max Enrollment     | 5                   |

      | Stop at            | 13:00               |
    And I create the following section for "Test-Driven Haskell":
      | Starts on | January 13, 2011 |
      | Ends on   | January 15, 2011 |
    And I sign out
    When I go to the home page
    And I follow the link to the Test-Driven Haskell course
    And I follow the link to register
    Then I should see "Complete your registration for Test-Driven Haskell"
    And I should see "$10000000"
    And I fill in the following:
      | First name            | Carlos             |

    And I press "Proceed to checkout"
    And carlos@santana.com is registered for the Test-Driven Haskell course
    And the freshbooks client id for "carlos@santana.com" is set correctly
    And a freshbooks invoice for "carlos@santana.com" is created with:
      | first_name   | Carlos        |

      | Workshop | 10000000  | 1        | Test-Driven Haskell |
    Then I am redirected to the freshbooks invoice page for "carlos@santana.com" on "Test-Driven Haskell"
    Then "workshops@thoughtbot.com" receives a registration notification email
