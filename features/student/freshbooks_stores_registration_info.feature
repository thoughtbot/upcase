  Scenario: Freshbooks stores information on paid section registration
    Given an audience exists with a name of "Developers"
    And the following course exists:

      | Test-Driven Haskell | name: Developers | 10000000 |
    And the following future section exists:
      | course                    |
      | name: Test-Driven Haskell |
    When I go to the home page
    And I follow "Test-Driven Haskell"
    And I follow "Register"
    When I fill in the required course registration fields for "carlos@santana.com"
    When I fill in the following:

    And I press "Proceed to checkout"
    Then the freshbooks client id for "carlos@santana.com" is set correctly
    And a freshbooks invoice for "carlos@santana.com" is created with:

      | Workshop | 10000000  | 1        | Test-Driven Haskell |
    Then I am redirected to the freshbooks invoice page for "carlos@santana.com" on "Test-Driven Haskell"
    And "billing@santana.com" receives an invoice email
    And "workshops@thoughtbot.com" should receive no emails
    And "carlos@santana.com" should receive no emails
    And the registration for "carlos@santana.com" taking "Test-Driven Haskell" should not be paid
    When I pay for "carlos@santana.com" taking "Test-Driven Haskell"
    Then "workshops@thoughtbot.com" receives a registration notification email
