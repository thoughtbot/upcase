Your #{__FILE__.gsub(/version_check.rb$/, 'env.rb')} file was generated with Cucumber 0.4.3,
but you seem to be running Cucumber #{Cucumber::VERSION}. If you're running an older 
version than #{Cucumber::VERSION}, just upgrade your gem. If you're running a newer 
version than #{Cucumber::VERSION} you should:

  1) Read http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/upgrading
  
  2) Regenerate your cucumber environment with the following command:

     ruby script/generate cucumber

If you get prompted to replace a file, hit 'd' to see the difference.
When you're sure you have captured any personal edits, confirm that you
want to overwrite #{__FILE__.gsub(/version_check.rb$/, 'env.rb')} by pressing 'y'. Then reapply any
personal changes that may have been overwritten, preferably in separate files.

This message will then self destruct.
