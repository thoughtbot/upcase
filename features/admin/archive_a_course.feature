    And a course exists with a name of "Test-Driven Sleeping"

  Scenario: Archive course

    When I go to the admin page
    And I follow "Test-Driven Sleeping"
    Then the "Public" checkbox should be checked
    When I uncheck "Public"
    And I press the button to update a course
    Then I see the successful course update notice
    When I go to the home page
    Then I should not see "Test-Driven Sleeping"
