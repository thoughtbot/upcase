        <h1>Week 2: Grid Systems</h1>
        <h2>Video</h2>
        <p> This weeks video is all about grid systems and how to implement grids on the web.</p>

        <h2>Workshop(s)</h2>
        <p> This week you have two workshops. The first one is sketching. In the video I go through my process for sketching. After you watch the video if you still need some clarification or want to see more examples let me know. I cannot reinforce enough how important sketching is and how much I'd like to see a BUNCH of sketches from you. Every new designer jumps to fast from sketching to Photoshop and the browser. There are many designers that fall in love with a idea too early too. If you can, take photos of your sketches or scans and send them over to me. At the very least I should see your final sketch that you&rsquo;d like to take to code or higher fidelity mock up.</p>

        <p> Based on your sketches you should have a good idea how you want things to be laid out. Start putting this content into code. Make sure that you keep things simple. For now, only use black white and gray keep your type to only Helvetica or Georgia. If your app already has color and type other than Helvetica or Georgia let me know.</p>

        <h2>Office Hours</h2>
        <p>This weeks office hours we will have a group critique of where you all are after implementing your grid. While giving critique, I want you all to use visual principles and elements of the grid to back up your critique and design decisions. Feel free to use the <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/d4d-resources/grid.html">cheatsheet</a> while you do your critique.</p>

        <p>This is a great time to ask me about grid frameworks if you have questions on that. I primarily use Neat but have experience with several other frameworks too.</p>
