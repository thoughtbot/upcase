      ALTERNATIVE_DESCRIPTION
      description: <<-DESCRIPTION.strip_heredoc
        This is the full source code the Rails app that runs the Upcase
        website. It includes authentication, users, subscription billing with
        Stripe, video tutorials, and more.

        As a subscriber, you have access to the source code of Upcase, this
        application. Clone it, disect it, and follow code reviews. See what a
        real-world, complex, fully tested production application looks like.

        We've been working full-time on Upcase for more than a year, and we
        think it's a good example of a large app with great code. Upcase has
        extensive test coverage, a full implementation of SaaS billing with
        Stripe, and serves as an OAuth endpoint for our Discourse forum, among
        other things. We encourage you to make changes and participate in pull
        request discussions. It has a 4.0 score on Code Climate.
