* break out of scope of paginated_each() yielded block when used on named scopes
* fix paginate(:from)

== 2.3.4, released 2008-09-16

* Rails 2.1: fix a failing test and a deprecation warning.
* Cope with scoped :select when counting.

== 2.3.3, released 2008-08-29

* Ensure that paginate_by_sql doesn't change the original SQL query.
* RDoc love (now live at http://mislav.caboo.se/static/will_paginate/doc/)
* Rename :prev_label to :previous_label for consistency. old name still functions but is deprecated

== 2.3.0, released 2008-04-29

* Changed LinkRenderer to receive collection, options and reference to view template NOT in
  constructor, but with the #prepare method. This is a step towards supporting passing of
  LinkRenderer (or subclass) instances that may be preconfigured in some way
* LinkRenderer now has #page_link and #page_span methods for easier customization of output in
  subclasses
* Changed page_entries_info() method to adjust its output according to humanized class name of
  collection items. Override this with :entry_name parameter (singular).
    
    page_entries_info(@posts)
    #-> "Displaying all 12 posts"
    page_entries_info(@posts, :entry_name => 'item')
    #-> "Displaying all 12 items"
    
== 2.2.3, released 2008-04-26

* will_paginate gem is no longer published on RubyForge, but on
  gems.github.com:
  
    gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/  (you only need to do this once)
    gem install mislav-will_paginate
    
* extract reusable pagination testing stuff into WillPaginate::View
* rethink the page URL construction mechanizm to be more bulletproof when
  combined with custom routing for page parameter
* test that anchor parameter can be used in pagination links

== 2.2.2, released 2008-04-21

* Add support for page parameter in custom routes like "/foo/page/2"
* Change output of "page_entries_info" on single-page collection and erraneous
  output with empty collection as reported by Tim Chater
  
== 2.2.1, released 2008-04-08

* take less risky path when monkeypatching named_scope; fix that it no longer
  requires ActiveRecord::VERSION
* use strings in "respond_to?" calls to work around a bug in acts_as_ferret
  stable (ugh)
* add rake release task


== 2.2.0, released 2008-04-07

=== API changes
* Rename WillPaginate::Collection#page_count to "total_pages" for consistency.
  If you implemented this interface, change your implementation accordingly.
* Remove old, deprecated style of calling Array#paginate as "paginate(page,
  per_page)". If you want to specify :page, :per_page or :total_entries, use a
  parameter hash.
* Rename LinkRenderer#url_options to "url_for" and drastically optimize it

=== View changes
* Added "prev_page" and "next_page" CSS classes on previous/next page buttons
* Add examples of pagination links styling in "examples/index.html"
* Change gap in pagination links from "..." to
  "<span class="gap">&hellip;</span>".
* Add "paginated_section", a block helper that renders pagination both above and
  below content in the block
* Add rel="prev|next|start" to page links

=== Other

* Add ability to opt-in for Rails 2.1 feature "named_scope" by calling
  WillPaginate.enable_named_scope (tested in Rails 1.2.6 and 2.0.2)
* Support complex page parameters like "developers[page]"
* Move Array#paginate definition to will_paginate/array.rb. You can now easily
  use pagination on arrays outside of Rails:

    gem 'will_paginate'
    require 'will_paginate/array'
    
* Add "paginated_each" method for iterating through every record by loading only
  one page of records at the time
* Rails 2: Rescue from WillPaginate::InvalidPage error with 404 Not Found by
  default
