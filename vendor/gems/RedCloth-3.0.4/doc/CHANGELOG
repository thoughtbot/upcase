    - Ensure angle brackets inside code quick tags get escaped.

- version: 2.0.10

  changes:
    - Table and list problems.  Rewrote the <pre> handling code.. again.

  changes:
    - Improved RDoc.  Ri documentation is auto-installed now!

      deeper passes scan for all HTML.  Now inlines work around HTML tags!

      if they are in <pre> tags.

      only once.  Thanks, David!

      indents was totally broken.
    - Fixed table problem.  Now glyphs are handled between tables and blocks.
    - Nested <pre> and <code> tags are now escaped.  Much better handling of
      HTML inside <pre> tags.  Really: quite nice.
