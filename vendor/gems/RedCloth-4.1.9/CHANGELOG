=== 4.1.9 / February 20, 2009

* Make compatible with Ruby 1.9.

* Image URLs and image titles can now contain parentheses. #71

* Handle caps properly in link titles. #77

* Remove extra preformatted line breaks after extended block code. #79

* Fix inline <notextile> being recognized as block <notextile>. #81

* Allow leading spaces on lists for backward compatibility with RedCloth 3.x. #89

* Recognize deleted phrases when they start at the beginning of a line. #83

* Fix escaped <code> tag when it has the class attribute and is in a <pre> tag. #95

* Fix dimensions and primes for LaTeX. #103

* Don't allow square brackets inside lang attribute so double square brackets are interpreted like Textile 2 and RedCloth 3. #101

* Improve LaTeX output for tables. #96

* Fix bad parsing of bracketed image links (which would hang the interpreter in some cases). #97

* Handle links containing parentheses.  Brackets are no longer required. #82 [Ryan Alyea]

* Made italics use the correct LaTeX tag: textit rather than emph. #98

* Fixed custom block signatures calling built-in Ruby String methods. #92

* Mentioned the three supported platforms and what's necessary to build RedCloth in the README file.

* Fixed a require problem that caused an error when you would gem check --test RedCloth. #91

=== 4.1.1 / November 19, 2008

* Added 'lib/case_sensitive_require' back into gemspec.  It got left out in the conversion to echoe, so "require 'RedCloth'" didn't work. #88

* Fixed <embed> being recognized as a block-level element when using the twice-cooked method of flash embedding. #87

* Added horizontal rules from RedCloth 3.  Three or more asterisks, dashes, or underscores between blocks triggers the HR tag.

* echoe was not being properly registered as a development dependency; a bug in RubyGems was making it a runtime dependency

* Fixed "No definition for redcloth_to Installing RDoc documentation"

* Fixed wrong platform names when cross-compiling java and win32 versions

=== 4.1.0 / October 31, 2008

* JRuby support!  [olabini]
  To run the tests with JRuby, you only need to: jruby -S rake
  To compile the jruby version of the gem: jruby -S rake compile

* Added textilize ERB utility method. [edraut]
  Use it in an ERB template like this: <%=t my_textile_string %> or 
  <%=r %{Some *textile* if you please!} %>

* Fix extended blockcode stripping whitespace following blank line. #78


=== 4.0.4 / October 1, 2008

* Added some very basic support for images in LaTeX. [virtualfunction]

* Fixed missed caps and inline modifiers wrapped in parentheses. #43, #45

* Removed indication of quotes explicitly with square brackets.  Textile 2.0 does not support this and it wasn't in RedCloth 3. #46

* Made percent signs less greedy.  They must surround a phrase or else they must be surrounded with square brackets, just like sup, sub, and del phrases. #47

* Reduced link eagerness so it wouldn't include preceding quoted phrases. #48

* Fixed compatibility issues with Ruby 1.9 [Keita Yamaguchi]. #52, 53, 54

* Fixed an error when a link was badly nested in parentheses. #55

* Fixed an error on superscript/subscript parenthetical phrase. #56

* Fixed bold phrases starting with a number being recognized as unordered lists. #60

* Fixed behavior of unclosed (multi-paragraph) quotes and incorrect handling of links inside double quotations. #59, #63

* Fixed empty block HTML disappearing. #64


=== 4.0.3 / August 18, 2008

* Fix NoMethodError: private method gsub!' called for nil:NilClass when two dimensions followed by a space. #38

* Fixed unititialized constant RedCloth::TextileDoc with Rails 2.1.  Came from a workaround for Rails bug #320 that was applied even when not necessary. #42


=== 4.0.2 / August 15, 2008

* Fixed link references/aliases not being recognized when they include hyphens. #36

* Dimensions in feet and inches use correct typographic characters. #25

* Limit overzealous superscript and subscript.  Sup/sub phrases must be surrounded by spaces or square brackets, as in Textile 2. #35

* Fixed HTML before tables causing the opening table tag to be emitted twice. #33

* Cleaned up unused code that was causing a warning. #28

* Workaround for Rails 2.1 bug that loads a previous version of RedCloth before loading the unpacked gem.  Has since been fixed in edge rails. #30

* Added a RedCloth::VERSION.to_s and .== methods so you can puts and compare RedCloth::VERSION just like in previous RedCloth releases. #26

* Fixed HTML block ending tags terminating blocks prematurely. #22


=== 4.0.1 / July 24, 2008

* Fixed lines starting with dashes being recognized as a definition list when there were no definitions.

* Created alias RedCloth.rb so Rails 2.1 gem dependency works on case-sensitive operating systems	.
* Fixed parsing sentences that had two em dashes surrounded by spaces from becoming del phrases. #19

* Fixed links including prior quoted phrases. #17


=== 4.0.0 / July 21, 2008

* New SuperRedCloth (RedCloth 4.0) is a total rewrite using Ragel for the parsing.

* Markdown support has been removed.

* Single newlines become <br> tags, just as in traditional RedCloth and other Textile parsers.

* HTML special characters are automatically escaped inside code signatures, like Textile 2.  This means you can simply write @<br />@ and the symbols are escaped whereas in RedCloth 3 you had to write @&lt;br /&gt;@ to make the code fragment readable.

* The restrictions parameter is observed just like previous versions (except :hard_breaks is now the default).

* Arguments to RedCloth#to_html are called so extensions made for prior versions can work.  Note: extensions need to be included rather than defined directly within the RedCloth class as was previously possible.

* Custom block tags can be implemented as in the previous version, though the means of implementing them differs.

* HTML embedded in the Textile input does not often need to be escaped from Textile parsing.

* The parser will not wrap lines that begin with a space in paragraph tags.

* Rudimentary support for LaTeX is built in.

* RedCloth::VERSION on a line by itself inserts the version number into the output.

* Output (less newlines and tabs) is identical to Textile 2 except a few cases where the RedCloth way was preferable.

* Over 500 tests prevent regression

* It's 40 times faster than the previous version.
