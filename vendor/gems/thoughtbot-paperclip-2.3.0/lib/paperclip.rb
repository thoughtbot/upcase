# Paperclip allows file attachments that are stored in the filesystem. All graphical
# transformations are done using the Graphics/ImageMagick command line utilities and
# are stored in Tempfiles until the record is saved. Paperclip does not require a
# separate model for storing the attachment's information, instead adding a few simple
# columns to your table.

# Paperclip defines an attachment as any file, though it makes special considerations
# for image files. You can declare that a model has an attached file with the
# +has_attached_file+ method:
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :thumb => "100x100" }
#   end
#
#   user = User.new
#   user.avatar = params[:user][:avatar]
#   user.avatar.url
#   # => "/users/avatars/4/original_me.jpg"
#   user.avatar.url(:thumb)
#   # => "/users/avatars/4/thumb_me.jpg"
#
# See the +has_attached_file+ documentation for more details.

  module ClassMethods
    # +has_attached_file+ gives the class it is called on an attribute that maps to a file. This
    # is typically a file stored somewhere on the filesystem and has been uploaded by a user. 
    # The attribute returns a Paperclip::Attachment object which handles the management of
    # that file. The intent is to make the attachment as much like a normal attribute. The 
    # thumbnails will be created when the new file is assigned, but they will *not* be saved 
    # until +save+ is called on the record. Likewise, if the attribute is set to +nil+ is 
    # called on it, the attachment will *not* be deleted until +save+ is called. See the 
    # Paperclip::Attachment documentation for more specifics. There are a number of options 
    # you can set to change the behavior of a Paperclip attachment:
    # * +url+: The full URL of where the attachment is publically accessible. This can just
    #   as easily point to a directory served directly through Apache as it can to an action
    #   that can control permissions. You can specify the full domain and path, but usually
    #   just an absolute path is sufficient. The leading slash *must* be included manually for 
    #   absolute paths. The default value is 
    #   "/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename". See
    #   Paperclip::Attachment#interpolate for more information on variable interpolaton.
    #     :url => "/:class/:attachment/:id/:style_:filename"
    #     :url => "http://some.other.host/stuff/:class/:id_:extension"
    # * +default_url+: The URL that will be returned if there is no attachment assigned. 
    #   This field is interpolated just as the url is. The default value is 
    #   "/:attachment/:style/missing.png"
    #     has_attached_file :avatar, :default_url => "/images/default_:style_avatar.png"
    #     User.new.avatar_url(:small) # => "/images/default_small_avatar.png"
    # * +styles+: A hash of thumbnail styles and their geometries. You can find more about 
    #   geometry strings at the ImageMagick website 
    #   (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#resize). Paperclip
    #   also adds the "#" option (e.g. "50x50#"), which will resize the image to fit maximally 
    #   inside the dimensions and then crop the rest off (weighted at the center). The 
    #   default value is to generate no thumbnails.
    # * +default_style+: The thumbnail style that will be used by default URLs. 
    #   Defaults to +original+.
    #     has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :normal => "100x100#" },
    #                       :default_style => :normal
    #     user.avatar.url # => "/avatars/23/normal_me.png"
    # * +whiny+: Will raise an error if Paperclip cannot post_process an uploaded file due
    #   to a command line error. This will override the global setting for this attachment. 
    #   Defaults to true. This option used to be called :whiny_thumbanils, but this is
    #   deprecated.
    # * +convert_options+: When creating thumbnails, use this free-form options
    #   field to pass in various convert command options.  Typical options are "-strip" to
    #   remove all Exif data from the image (save space for thumbnails and avatars) or
    #   "-depth 8" to specify the bit depth of the resulting conversion.  See ImageMagick
    #   convert documentation for more options: (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php)
    #   Note that this option takes a hash of options, each of which correspond to the style
    #   of thumbnail being generated. You can also specify :all as a key, which will apply
    #   to all of the thumbnails being generated. If you specify options for the :original,
    #   it would be best if you did not specify destructive options, as the intent of keeping
    #   the original around is to regenerate all the thumbnails when requirements change.
    #     has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :large => "300x300", :negative => "100x100" }
    #                                :convert_options => {
    #                                  :all => "-strip",
    #                                  :negative => "-negate"
    #                                }
    #   NOTE: While not deprecated yet, it is not recommended to specify options this way.
    #   It is recommended that :convert_options option be included in the hash passed to each
    #   :styles for compatability with future versions.
    # * +storage+: Chooses the storage backend where the files will be stored. The current
    #   choices are :filesystem and :s3. The default is :filesystem. Make sure you read the
    #   documentation for Paperclip::Storage::Filesystem and Paperclip::Storage::S3
