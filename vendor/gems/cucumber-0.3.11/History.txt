== 0.3.11 2009-06-05

This release just fixes a tiny bug in the formatter to fix an incompatibility
with the latest RedMine release. It should have been included in 0.3.10, but
was forgotten.

=== Bugfixes
* Formatter API was broken in 0.3.9 (Roman Chernyatchik)

== 0.3.10 2009-06-05

The Spork Release!

This release has an exciting new feature - a new --drb switch! This magic switch lets you run your
features much faster than before, because you can eliminate the startup time for your code. This is
thanks to a brand new gem called Spork by Tim Harper and Ben Mabey. (You can find out more about Spork 
here: http://github.com/timcharper/spork/tree/master). You can start Spork and have it preload your 
application in a separate process. Spork listens for DRb connections, and when you run cucumber with 
--drb the features will run inside the Spork server instead. Spork provides two simple hooks for preloading 
your application - one for framework/stable code (Spork.prefork) and one for the code that *you* write and 
change often (Spork.each_run). Keep in mind that all World, Before, and other Cucumber hooks need to be
in the Spork.each_run block.  Using Spork works great for Ruby on Rails, which can take a while to load, 
but --drb and Spork aren't tied to Rails at all. The new --drb switch also works great alongside autotest 
(just add --drb to your autotest profile in cucumber.yml), so now you can get even faster feedback.

Cucumber's built-in cucumber generator now has a new --spork switch, so when you bootstrap your Rails
application for cucumber, you can have spork configuration set up out of the box. (It's just a
slightly different env.rb.)

Although Spork was in mind when the --drb switch was added it is important to realize that all that was added
to Cucumber was a DRb client.  Any DRb server that adheres to this protocol can be used with Cucumber's --drb
switch. While Spork is geared towards removing the load time to give you a faster feedback loop you could 
just as easily use this client with a server that distributes your features to run in parallel. Someone just
needs to write such a server. ;)

This release also has some minor bugfixes related to RSpec and Rails interop.

=== Bugfixes
* RSpec's be_* matchers did not work in 0.3.9 and probably earlier versions. Now they do. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The Rails cucumber environment won't declare gem dependencies if the plugin exists. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* The Rails cucumber generator will no longer declare gem dependencies on rspec if you use --testunit. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Spork support via --drb. (Ben Mabey)
* Added a Ast::Feature#name method for convenience. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed features
* The HTML formatter wraps examples in a div, and distinguishes between Scenario and Scenario Outline. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.9 2009-05-27

Bugfix release for 0.3.8 released earlier today. 0.3.8 had a bug in the Rails cucumber
generator which is fixed in 0.3.9.

=== Bugfixes
* Fix broken Rails cucumber generator (Tim Glen)
* The Cucumber Rake task in non-fork mode will properly cause Rake to exit with 1 when Cucumber fails. (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.8 2009-05-27

This Cucumber version fixes several bugs related to Ruby on Rails and RSpec. If you
use Cucumber with a Rails app we *strongly* recommend you bootstrap Cucumber again:

  ruby script/generate cucumber

=== New Features
* Rails cucumber generator sets up default gem dependencies in cucumber environment.
* The duration of a run is reported by formatters - same format as the Linux time command (#228 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Scenario and ExampleRow objects (passed to Before and After hooks) have #name and #line methods (#316 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Rails generator creates a cucumber environment file to avoid potential cache_classes conflicts in test.rb (#165, Ben Mabey)
* HTML formatter renders @tags (but the CSS is still ugly)

=== Removed/changed features
* The Cucumber Rake task will again fork by default (as 0.3.3 and earlier). Forking must be turned off explicitly. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* Better coexistence with RSpec - Cucumber now *neuters* the part of RSpec that tries to parse ARGV.
* The differ= exception is gone (#325, #340 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.7 2009-05-22

This is the "Help JetBrains RubyMine" release!

=== New Features
* Added new Given alias for Catalan: Donat|Donada (Lleïr Borràs Metje)
* New --expand option. This will print Scenario Outlines once for each Example row - with values expanded. (#327 Aslak Hellesøy)
* You can override the formatter in Rails-generated rake tasks with the CUCUMBER_FORMAT environment variable (#335 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Bugfixes
* 'specs' folder needs to be renamed back to 'spec' (#339 Aslak Hellesøy)
* CUCUMBER_OPTS doesn't work for cucumber rake tasks (#336 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.6 2009-05-20

Kanban! With this release you can tag features or scenarios that are work in progress
with a tag and use the new --wip switch.

Another handy feature in this release is that you can package your own formatters in RubyGems.

=== New features
* New --wip switch. See http://www.jroller.com/perryn/entry/bdd_on_a_multi_disciplined (Perryn Fowler)
* Added a AfterStep hook (Luke Melia)
* New aliases for Vietnamese (Ngoc Dao)
* Automatic require of custom formatters. --require is no longer needed to load them, and they can be in Ruby gems. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Lazy loading of built-in formatters. Should improve startup time a little bit.

=== Bugfixes
* Gracefully handle exceptions in After block (#330 Matt Wynne)
* Feature with only Background doesn't run hooks (#314, #329 Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.3.5 2009-05-14

Let's make a new release today because two annoying bugs are fixed.

=== Bugfixes
* Allow feature element names to contain Gherkin keywords as long as they are not the first word on a newline (#319, #307 Joseph Wilk)

== 0.3.4 2009-05-14

A couple of great new features in this release. Running with Rake is faster than before,
and there is a brand new JUnit formatter - great for Continuous Integration reports!

This release was made especially for the Oslo XP Meetup today.

** IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES FOR RAILS USERS **

Running Cucumber features in the same Ruby interpreter as Rake doesn't seem to work,
so you have to explicitly tell the task to fork (like it was doing by default in prior
versions). In lib/tasks/cucumber.rake:

  Cucumber::Rake::Task.new(:features) do |t|
    t.fork = true # Explicitly fork
    t.cucumber_opts = %w{--format pretty}
  end

(If you run script/generate cucumber this will be done for you).
Alternatively you can omit forking and run features like this:

  RAILS_ENV=test rake features

However, setting the RAILS_ENV is easy to forget, so I don't recommend relying on this.

=== Bugfixes
* Hooks (World, Before, After) are no longer executed when --dry-run (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Proper UTF8 use in HTML formatter (Herminio Torres)
* Problem with multiple terms in languages.yml (#321 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* New JUnit formatter (Gareth Jones)
* Support for Vietnamese (Ngoc Dao)
* Added aliases for Feature and But in Japanese (Leonard Chin)
* Support for Catalan (Francesc Esplugas)

=== Changed features
* --exclude flag now works on ruby files in addition to feature files (#312 Ben Mabey)
* The Java example under examples/java uses Ant instead of Rake - and the new JUnit formatter.
* Rake task should not shell out (#297 Aslak Hellesøy)
  The Cucumber Rake task will run Cucumber in the same Ruby interpreter as Rake itself
  unless explicitly told to fork a new interpreter. This is to increase speed. You can
  force a new interpreter by setting fork=true or rcov=true in the task.

== 0.3.3 2009-05-10

Minor bugfix release, made specially for EuRuKo!

=== Bugfixes
* Summaries are no longer printed in an empty () if there are no scenarios/steps (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Background, Scenario Outline, Before Hook interaction (#309 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Multiline String snippets no longer give misleading info. It's a String, not a PyString that's sent to step def.

=== Removed/changed features
* New aliases: --no-source/-s, --name/-n (#317 Lonnon Foster)

== 0.3.2 2009-05-05

== 0.3.0 2009-04-14

This release has some minor changes to the APIs, but big enough that a new major release is in order.
The biggest change is the new semantics of the #World method. Previously you would call this method
several times, passing a Proc and extending the world object of the previous one with a Ruby module.
The problem was that there was no nice way to ensure the order in which these procs were called, which
led to some unexpected situations. In this release you can only register a single World proc. If you
want to extend a world with certain modules, you simply call the #World method with the module(s)
you wish to extend the World with. The Sinatra example illustrates how to do this. Also check out
the RDoc for Cucumber::StepMother#World.

The Visitor API (which is used for formatters) has also changed slightly. However, we have tried to
do this in a backwards compatible way, so if you have custom formatters for Cucumber 0.2 they should
still work.

One of the most significant new features is Tagged Hooks: http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/hooks
This lets you associate Before and After blocks with specific scenarios.

We are also deprecating the step_list, step_pattern, feature_list, and feature_pattern accessors on
Cucumber::Rake::Task. These accessors will be completely removed in version 0.4. For complex settings 
please rely on cucumber profiles in your rake tasks:
http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/using-rake#profiles

=== New features
* Use Hooks with @tags (#229 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Rake task supports cucumber.yml profiles (#187 Ben Mabey)
* Field value steps for Webrat (Jack Chen)
* Added translation for Bulgarian (Krasimir Angelov)
* Updated translation for Polish (#273 Grzegorz Marszałek)
* Only a single World proc can be registered. World extension now happens by calling #World with ruby modules.
* Portuguese uses Funcionalidade in stead of Característica and accented words are aliased with unaccented ones (Alexandre da Silva and Felipe Coury).
* The usage formatter also prints unused step definitions (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Better exception if a World proc returns nil. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Allow Step Definitions to use |*varargs|, but only on Ruby 1.9. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Snippets for steps that use Step Tables or PyStrings include block param and object type hint comment (#247 Joseph Wilk)
* Support description string for Backgrounds (#271 Joseph Wilk)

=== Bugfixes
* After methods not being executed when Background fails (#288 Luismi Cavallé)
* Fixed dependency on internal files in rspec breaks cucumber w/ rspec-1.2.4 (#291 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fix color use when using autotest on Linux. (Hans de Graaff)
* Fixed incorrect calculation of pystring indentation (#279 Eugene Naydanov)
* Fixed --format html leads to an error (#252 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Background runs twice (#255 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Background Transactions and :xx (#270 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed Autospec failing with cucumber 0.2 (#254 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Sibling file detecting not working (#278 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed/changed features
* The visitor API has changed slightly:
** #visit_step_name, #visit_multiline_arg and #visit_exception are no longer official API methods.
** #visit_step_result replaces those 3 methods.
** Table and PyString no longer hold status information. Each visitor subclass should store state in @state if needed.
** #visit_py_string no longer takes a status argument.

== 0.2.3 2009-03-30

This release sports 4 updated languages, slightly better help with snippets if you "quote" arguments
in your steps. Windows/JRuby users can enjoy colours and you get some more sugar with Tables.

=== New features
* Added new Then /^I should be on (.+)$/ do |page_name| step (Grant Hollingworth)
* Use skipped_param color for examples table header (#266 Eugene Naydanov)
* Added new Cucumber::Ast::Table#rows_hash method (Torbjørn Vatn)
* Windows/JRuby users can now enjoy colourful output (via http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/ansicolor) (#166 Aslak Hellesøy)

* Added translation for Slovak (Ahmed Al Hafoudh) 
* Updated translation for Dutch (Bart Zonneveld)
* Updated translation for Italian (Alessandro Baroni)
* Updated translation for Japanese (KAKUTANI Shintaro)

=== Bugfixes

* Backtrace is back in HTML reports (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.2.2 2009-03-25

This release includes some minor changes to make Cucumber work with pure Java. Cucumber
has already worked with Java for a while (using JRuby and step definitions in Ruby),
but now you can write step definitions in pure Java!

Check out the Cucumber Java project for more details:
http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber_java/tree/master

== 0.2.1 2009-03-25

This release fixes a few minor bugs and adds a couple of new features.

== Bugfixes
* Fixed Cucumber, and rails controller error handling (#49 Matt Patterson)
* HTML Formatter doesn't work correctly with scenario Outlines. (#260 Aslak Hellesøy)
* After blocks are run in reverse order of registration. (#113 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Snippets are showing 'Ands' (#249 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Snippets use a regexp and block arguments if the step name has "quoted" arguments. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Cucumber::Ast::Feature#to_sexp includes the file name. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* support/env.rb is not loaded when --dry-run is specified. This is to increase performance. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* New usage formatter. This is the foundation for editor autocompletion and navigation between steps and step definitions. (#209 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed features
* -S/--step-definitions option introduced in 0.2.0 is removed. Use --format usage [--dry-run] [--no-color].

== 0.2.0 2009-03-18

This release sports a bunch of new and exciting features, as well a major rewrite of Cucumber's internals. 
The rewrite was done to address technical debt and to have a code base that is easier to evolve and maintain. 

There are some changes to the Gherkin language that breaks backwards compatible with the 0.1.x series. 
Most importantly, "GivenScenario" and "More Examples" no longer exist. See the "Removed features" section 
below for more details on how to use alternatives.

Since the grammar has changed, there are some new keywords. We have to rely on the community
to provide updated translations. This is much easier than before - just update languages.yml.
There is no static code generation anymore. To list all languages:

  cucumber --lang help
  
And to list the keywords for a particular language:

  cucumber --lang en-lol help
  
There are some really awesome new features in this release: Tagging, Autoformatting, automatic 
aliasing of keywords in all languages, full Ruby 1.9 support and improved output 
for multiline arguments are some of the highlights. 

== Bugfixes
* New StepInvocation breaks console formatter for pending steps. (#241 Jacob Radford) 
* Within Scenario Outlines when replacing with a nil in a step name use empty string instead. (#237 Joseph Wilk)

* Fix error with nil values in tables raising an exception (#227 Joseph Wilk)
* Add support for using << in formatters to ensure the html formatter works (#210 Joseph Wilk)
* Explicitly require env.rb files first to avoid potential load order problems. (#213, Ben Mabey, Randy Harmon)

* Adding support for Background (#153 Joseph Wilk) 
* Added Česky/Czech (Vojtech Salbaba)
* New --no-multiline option to reduce noise in output. Useful if lots of features are failing. (Aslak Hellesøy)

* Multiline arguments (tables and """ strings) are printed in the output. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* It's no longer necessary to compile the Treetop grammar when adding a new language. Localised parser is generated at runtime. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed features
* "GivenScenario" is gone. Instead you can call Steps from Step Definitions, or use the new Background feature (#153)

* Pure Ruby features are no longer supported.
* Remove --color option in autotest. Can be added manually in cucumber.yml (#215 Jean-Michel Garnier)

== (0.1.16.4 aslakhellesoy-cucumber gem on GitHub)

Bugfix release.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR RAILS USERS.
The template used to generate your features/support/env.rb has changed. You have to apply a minor change
manually for existing Rails projects when you upgrade to this version. Change this:

  require 'webrat/rspec-rails'

to this:

  require 'webrat/core/matchers'

=== New features

* Flush output in HTML formatter since JRuby doesnt do it automatically (Diego Carrion)
* Better handling of ARGV (#169 David Chelimsky, Ben Mabey)
* Compatibility with ruby-debug (do ARGV.dup in bin/cucumber so it can restart ruby with same args) (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.16 2009-01-19

This is a small bugfix release. The most notable improvement is compatibility with Webrat 0.4. Rails/Webrat users should
upgrade both Cucumber and Webrat gems.

=== New features
* Allow argument placeholders in step tables and multiline comments (#121 Joseph Wilk)
* Scenario Outline can be followed by several named Examples sections (#123 Aslak Hellesøy)

* Added some small workarounds for unicode handling on Windows (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.14 2009-01-04

This is the first release of Cucumber that runs on Ruby 1.9. There are still some encoding-related issues 
with Arabic (ar), Japanese (ja) and Simplified Chinese (zh-CN). Patches are welcome. Other than that - 
a couple of minor bug fixes and polishing.

=== New features
* Pretty formatter shows number of scenarios (#139 Joseph Wilk)
* Rudimentary support for Ruby 1.9. Now it's ok to file Ruby 1.9-related bugs.

== 0.1.13 2008-12-20

It's time for some new features again. Output is now much better since you can use diffing, tweak
the output colours and get the full --backtrace if you want. Managing your support/* files became 
a little easier since they are now always loaded before the step definitions. Life became easier 
for Windows users in Norway (and other countries using unicode in the features). Plus several other 
bug fixes.

Enjoy!

=== New features
* Console output is no longer bold, but regular. Step arguments are bold instead of blold+underlined. (Aslak Hellesøy)

* Scenario Outlines which through placeholders in the steps allow control of how scenario table values are used. (#57 Joseph Wilk)
* Scenario Outlines are now usable in pure ruby (Joseph Wilk)
* Add support for calling 'pending' from step definitions. (#112 Joseph Wilk)

* Change 'visits' to 'visit' in features generator to comply with new Webrat API (Darius Roberts)

=== Removed features

== 0.1.12 2008-12-04

This is the "getting serious with IronRuby release" - largely based on 
"Patrick Gannon":http://www.patrickgannon.net/archive/2008/10/23/bdd-style-feature-tests-using-ironruby-and-rspeccucumber.aspx's
blog entry.

== New features
* Cucumber works with IronRuby/.NET - http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/ironruby-and-net (Aslak Hellesøy)

== Bugfixes

This will run foo.feature at line 15 and bar.feature at line 6, 45 and 111.

=== New features
* Added example showing how to use Cucumber with Test::Unit + Matchy instead of RSpec (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.9 2008-11-12

With this release Cucumber supports 19 (!) natural languages:

* Arabic
* Chinese Simplified
* Danish
* Dutch
* Estonian
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Malay
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Texan
* Welsh

Thanks a lot to everyone who has contributed translations. If you don't see your language here, please
add it: http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/spoken-languages

Main functional changes in this release is "Autotest":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/autotest-integration
support and how multiline strings work in feature files:

  # In your .feature file
  Then I should see
    """
    A string
      that "indents"
    and spans
    several lines
  
    """

  # In your steps.rb file
  Then 'I should see' do |text|
    text.should == "A string\n  that \"indents\"\nand spans\nseveral lines\n"
  end

The triple quotes are used to define the start and end of a string, and it also defines what gets stripped away
in the inside string. If the triple quotes are indented 4 spaces, then the text within will have the 4 first
spaces removed too.

=== Removed features


== 0.1.8 2008-10-18

This release extends the support for tables. PLEASE NOTE THAT TABLES ARE STILL EXPERIMENTAL.
In previous releases it has been possible to use tables to define "more examples" of a scenario i
n a FIT-style column fixture kind of way. Now you can also use tables as arguments to steps.

Tables used to define more examples after a scenario must now be prefixed. In English it looks like this:

  Feature: Addition
    In order to avoid silly mistakes
    As a math idiot 
    I want to be told the sum of two numbers

    Scenario: Add two numbers
      Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
      And I have entered 70 into the calculator
      When I press add
      Then the result should be 120 on the screen

    More Examples:
      | input_1 | input_2 | button | output |
      | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     |
      | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      |
      | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     |

Languages that are not updated yet will have to use "More Examples" until we get the translations.

Tables can also be used as arguments to individual steps. In fact, steps now support a single argument 
that can span several lines. This can be a table or a string.

Example:

  Given the following people exist:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
    | Bryan | bryan@email.org | 456   |
  When I search for email.com
  Then I should see:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
  And I should see:
    "Some text
    on several lines"

The step definitions for such multiline steps must define an extra block argument for the argument:

  Given /the following people exist:/ do |people_table|
    # people_table is of type Cucumber::Model::Table
    # See RDoc for more info
  end

  Then /I should see:/ do |string|
    # string is a plain old ruby String with leading spaces on each line removed
  end

=== New features
* Added profile formatter. (#35, Joseph Wilk)
* Added support for Chinese Simplified. (Liming Lian)
* Added support for Dutch. (Sjoerd Tieleman)
* Multiline steps are now supported. (#4, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Tables used to define more examples for a scenario must be prefixed "More Examples" (see languages.yml for other languages)
* Show the file and line number for scenarios as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the file for the feature as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the feature file and line for pending steps as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed speling errors in Spanish (Daniel Cadenas)
* ActionMailer delivery_method should not be set to test (#41, Luke Melia)
* Reverse incorrectly ordered args in webrat select step (#43, David Chelimsky)
* Support comments above the first scenario (#31, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed the HTML Formatter to use actual values for FIT table headers (#30, Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* Removed the /^I go to (.*)$/ step from common_webrat.rb - it's not language agnostic and provides little value.

=== New features
* Added new --out option to make it easier to specify output from Rake and cucumber.yml

== 0.1.7 2008-10-05

This release fixes a few bugs and adds some new features. The most notable features are:

=== Calling steps from steps

Step definitions are a little bit closer to having regular method semantics.
You define them, but now you can also call them from other steps. Here is an
example:

  Given /I am logged in as an (.*) named (.*)$/ do |role, name|
    Given "I am registered as #{role}, #{name}, secret"
    When "I log in with #{name}, secret"
  end
  
  Given /I am registered as (.*), (.*), (.*)/ do |role, name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

  When /I log in with (.*), (.*)/ do |name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

This means that steps can be reused in other steps. The GivenScenario feature achieves a similar
effect (on the scenario level), but this feature is something we're not very happy with, mostly
because it's not parameterisable. Calling steps from steps is.

GivenScenario will still be working several releases, but the plan is to remove it completely in 
the 0.3.0 release.

=== Seeing where a step is defined

Prior to this release it could be hard to find out where the ruby step definition matching
a plain text step is defined. Not anymore! Cucumber will now output this:

  Scenario: Regular numbers
    Given I have entered 3 into the calculator   # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    And I have entered 2 into the calculator     # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    When I press divide                          # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:16
    Then the result should be 1.5 on the screen  # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:20
    And the result class should be Float         # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:24

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed a bug in the command line args being lost when using --profile (#27, Joseph Wilk)
* Fixed a bug in Webrat selects (Tim Glen)
* Fixed parsing of DOS line endings (#2, #28, Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Steps can be called from other steps (#3, Bryan Helmkamp, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added But keyword to all languages (#21, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added --no-source option to display step definition location next to step text (#26, Joseph Wilk, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added more Webrat steps (#25, Tim Glen)

== 0.1.6 2008-10-01

First gem release!
