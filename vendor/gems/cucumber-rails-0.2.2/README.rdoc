= cucumber-rails

Extracted the Rails generators from the Cucumber gem, inspired by
{this posting}[http://groups.google.com/group/cukes/browse_thread/thread/b9b8ff6301393c19"]
on the Cukes Mailing List.

The goal is to provide i18n of the webrat_steps.rb plus some other useful
enhancements.

== Install

  gem install cucumber-rails

== Usage

Once you install the gem, the generators will be available to all Rails
applications on your system. If you run script/generate without any
additional arguments you should see the available generators listed.

To run the generator, go to your rails project directory and call it
using the script/generate or script/destroy command.

  script/generate cucumber


== Included Generators

* cucumber: Sets up Cucumber in your Rails project
* feature: Generates a skeleton for a new feature

To view the README for each generator, run it with the --help option.

  script/generate cucumber --help

== Tests

This project has tests, but for practical and historical reasons they live in a different project:
