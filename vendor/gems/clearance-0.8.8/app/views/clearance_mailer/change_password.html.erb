Someone, hopefully you, has requested that we send you a link to change your password.

Here's the link:

<%= edit_user_password_url(@user,
      :token  => @user.confirmation_token,
      :escape => false) %>

If you didn't request this, ignore this email. Don't worry. Your password hasn't been changed.
