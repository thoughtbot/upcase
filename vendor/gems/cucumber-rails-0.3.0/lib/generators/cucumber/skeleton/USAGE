Description:
    Sets up Cucumber in your Rails project. After running this generator you will
    get a new rake task called features.
    
    This also generates the necessary files in the features directory.
    
    Also see the feature generator, which you can use to generate skeletons
    for new features.
    
Examples (Rails 3):
    `script/rails generate cucumber:skeleton`

    You can also provide a language argument for localized webrat_steps:
    `script/rails generate cucumber:skeleton de`

Examples (Rails 2):
    `script/generate cucumber`

    You can also provide a language argument for localized webrat_steps:
    `script/generate cucumber de`
