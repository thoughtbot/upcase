== RDoc Documentation ==

Once your plugin is stable and you are ready to deploy do everyone else a favor and document it!  Luckily, writing documentation for your plugin is easy.

The first step is to update the README file with detailed information about how to use your plugin.  A few key things to include are:

 * Your name
 * How to install
 * How to add the functionality to the app (several examples of common use cases)
 * Warning, gotchas or tips that might help save users time

Once your README is solid, go through and add rdoc comments to all of the methods that developers will use.  It's also customary to add '#:nodoc:' comments to those parts of the code that are not part of the public api.

Once your comments are good to go, navigate to your plugin directory and run:

---------------------------------------------------------
rake rdoc
---------------------------------------------------------
