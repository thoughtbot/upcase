Action Controller basics
=======================

In this guide you will learn how controllers work and how they fit into the request cycle in your application. After reading this guide, you will be able to:

* Follow the flow of a request through a controller
* Understand why and how to store data in the session or cookies
* Work with filters to execute code during request processing
* Use Action Controller's built-in HTTP authentication
* Stream data directly to the user's browser
* Filter sensitive parameters so they do not appear in the application's log
* Deal with exceptions that may be raised during request processing
