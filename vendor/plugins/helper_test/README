= Helper Test Generator

Makes stubs so you can test helpers.

The helpers are placed in test/unit/helpers and will be run automatically when you run unit tests.

= Usage

Run the helper_test generator with the shortened name of the helper you want to test.

  # For TaskHelper
  ./script/generate helper_test Task

Require the parent testcase class in your test_helper.rb

  require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/helper_testcase')

The testcase includes common helpers, but you can add others if necessary.

= Examples

  # Make a test for the BlogHelper
  ./script/generate helper_test Blog

  # Make a test for Admin::UsersHelper
  ./script/generate helper_test Admin::Users

Sub-folders will be made, if necessary.
