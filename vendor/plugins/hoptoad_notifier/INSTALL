HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad.

When an uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST the relevant data 
to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.


INSTALLATION
------------

REMOVE EXCEPTION_NOTIFIER

In your ApplicationController, REMOVE this line:

  include ExceptionNotifiable

In your config/environment* files, remove all references to ExceptionNotifier

Remove the vendor/plugins/exception_notifier directory.

INSTALL HOPTOAD_NOTIFIER

From your project's RAILS_ROOT, run:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/thoughtbot/hoptoad_notifier.git

CONFIGURATION

You should have something like this in config/initializers/hoptoad.rb.

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = '1234567890abcdef'
  end
  
(Please note that this configuration should be in a global configuration, and
is *not* enrivonment-specific. Hoptoad is smart enough to know what errors are
caused by what environments, so your staging errors don't get mixed in with
your production errors.)

After this is in place, all exceptions will be logged to Hoptoad where they can 
be aggregated, filtered, sorted, analyzed, massaged, and searched.

** NOTE FOR RAILS 1.2.* USERS: **
You will need to copy the hoptoad_notifier_tasks.rake file into your
RAILS_ROOT/lib/tasks directory in order for the following to work:

You can test that hoptoad is working in your production environment by using 
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake hoptoad:test

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to hoptoad 
which will be visible immediately.
