This is Suspenders, the thoughtbot rails template.  To create a new project, checkout this
repository and run:

  ./script/create_project.rb projectname

This will create a project in ../projectname.  You should then follow the
instructions on Github to upload that project there.  This script creates an
entirely new git repository, and is not meant to be used against an existing
repo.

When making a change to a project that was created via this template, consider
whether it's a change that should be made across all projects.  If so, then
make the change in this template, and pull it into your project via:

  git pull git@github.com:thoughtbot/suspenders.git master

Rake Tasks

  bootstrap
  Provides rake tasks for loading data into the database.  These are used for an initial application dataset needed for production.
  
  capstrano
  Standard capistrano deployment tasks
  
  git_tasks
  Tasks for deployment management to staging and production when using git.
  
Testing

  Testing is done utilizing Test::Unit, Shoulda, factory_girl, and mocha.
  
  factory_girl is a fixture replacement library, following the factory pattern.  Place your
  factories in test/factories.rb.  The fixture directory has been removed, as fixtures are not
  used.
  
  Shoulda is a pragmatic testing framework for TDD and BDD built on top of Test::Unit.  A number of additional
  testing macros are provided in test/shoulda_macros.
    shoulda_have_form
    shoulda_paginate_collection

Deployment

  Deployment is done using capistrano, and deploys to a mongrel cluster, running under Apache.
  
  Rake tasks are provided for managing git branches which the different environments pull from
  for deploy.
  
  To push the git master to git staging branch run
    rake git:push:staging
  To push the git staging branch to production branch run
    rake git:push:production
  
  Setup your deployment environment by running 
    cap ENVIRONMENT deploy:setup
    (You'll be prompted for the environment's database password)
  
  Deploy to the desired environment by running
    cap ENVIRONMENT deploy
    
  The default environment for deploy is staging, to deploy to staging, just run
    cap deploy
