This is Suspenders, the thoughtbot rails template. To create a new project, checkout this
repository and run:

  ./script/create_project projectname

This will create a project in ../projectname.  You should then follow the
instructions on Github to upload that project there.  This script creates an
entirely new git repository, and is not meant to be used against an existing
repo.

When making a change to a project that was created via this template, consider
whether it's a change that should be made across all projects.  If so, then
make the change in this template, and pull it into your project via:

  git pull suspenders master
  
About Suspenders

of our applications used, as well as best-practice configuration options.

Suspenders currently includes Rails 2.3.2

Rake Tasks
----------

Rake tasks are contained in the limerick_rake gem.

  bootstrap
  Provides rake tasks for loading data into the database.  These are used for an initial application dataset needed for production.
  
  capistrano
  Standard capistrano deployment tasks
  
Testing
-------

Testing is done utilizing Test::Unit, Shoulda, factory_girl, and mocha.

factory_girl is a fixture replacement library, following the factory pattern.  Place your
factories in test/factories.rb.  The fixture directory has been removed, as fixtures are not
used.

Shoulda is a pragmatic testing framework for TDD and BDD built on top of Test::Unit.  A number of additional
testing macros are provided in test/shoulda_macros:

  shoulda_have_form
  shoulda_paginate_collection

Deployment
----------

Deployment is done using capistrano, and deploys to a mongrel cluster, running under Apache.

Rake tasks are provided for managing git branches which the different environments pull from
for deploy.

To push the git master to git staging branch run:

  rake git:push:staging

To push the git staging branch to production branch run:

  rake git:push:production

Setup your deployment environment by running:

  cap ENVIRONMENT deploy:setup
  (You'll be prompted for the environment's database password)

Deploy to the desired environment by running:

  cap ENVIRONMENT deploy
  
The default environment for deploy is staging, to deploy to staging, just run:

  cap deploy

Mascot

The official Suspenders mascot is Suspenders Boy:
