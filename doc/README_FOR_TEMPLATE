This is the Thoughtbot Rails Template.  To create a new project, checkout this
repository and run:

  ./script/create_project.rb projectname

This will create a project in ../projectname.  You should then follow the
instructions on Github to upload that project there.  This script creates an
entirely new git repository, and is not meant to be used against an existing
repo.

When making a change to a project that was created via this template, consider
whether it's a change that should be made across all projects.  If so, then
make the change in this template, and pull it into your project via:

  git pull git@github.com:thoughtbot/rails-template.git master
