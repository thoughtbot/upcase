    # The default place to store attachments is in the filesystem. Files on the local
    # filesystem can be very easily served by Apache without requiring a hit to your app.
    # They also can be processed more easily after they've been saved, as they're just
    # normal files. There is one Filesystem-specific option for has_attached_file.
    # * +path+: The location of the repository of attachments on disk. This can (and, in
    #   almost all cases, should) be coordinated with the value of the +url+ option to
    #   allow files to be saved into a place where Apache can serve them without
    #   hitting your app. Defaults to
    #   ":rails_root/public/:attachment/:id/:style/:basename.:extension"
    #   By default this places the files in the app's public directory which can be served
    #   directly. If you are using capistrano for deployment, a good idea would be to
    #   make a symlink to the capistrano-created system directory from inside your app's
    #   public directory.
    #   See Paperclip::Attachment#interpolate for more information on variable interpolaton.

    # Amazon's S3 file hosting service is a scalable, easy place to store files for
    # distribution. You can find out more about it at http://aws.amazon.com/s3
    # There are a few S3-specific options for has_attached_file:
    # * +s3_credentials+: Takes a path, a File, or a Hash. The path (or File) must point
    #   to a YAML file containing the +access_key_id+ and +secret_access_key+ that Amazon
    #   gives you. You can 'environment-space' this just like you do to your
    #   database.yml file, so different environments can use different accounts:
    #     development:
    #       access_key_id: 123...
    #       secret_access_key: 123...
    #     test:
    #       access_key_id: abc...
    #       secret_access_key: abc...
    #     production:
    #       access_key_id: 456...
    #       secret_access_key: 456...
    #   This is not required, however, and the file may simply look like this:
    #     access_key_id: 456...
    #     secret_access_key: 456...
    #   In which case, those access keys will be used in all environments. You can also
    #   put your bucket name in this file, instead of adding it to the code directly.
    #   This is useful when you want the same account but a different bucket for
    #   development versus production.
    # * +s3_permissions+: This is a String that should be one of the "canned" access
    #   policies that S3 provides (more information can be found here:
    #   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/RESTAccessPolicy.html#RESTCannedAccessPolicies)
    #   The default for Paperclip is :public_read.
    # * +s3_protocol+: The protocol for the URLs generated to your S3 assets. Can be either
    #   'http' or 'https'. Defaults to 'http' when your :s3_permissions are :public_read (the
    #   default), and 'https' when your :s3_permissions are anything else.
    # * +s3_headers+: A hash of headers such as {'Expires' => 1.year.from_now.httpdate}
    # * +bucket+: This is the name of the S3 bucket that will store your files. Remember
    #   that the bucket must be unique across all of Amazon S3. If the bucket does not exist
    #   Paperclip will attempt to create it. The bucket name will not be interpolated.
    #   You can define the bucket as a Proc if you want to determine it's name at runtime.
    #   Paperclip will call that Proc with attachment as the only argument.
    # * +s3_host_alias+: The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that is the alias to the
    #   S3 domain of your bucket. Used with the :s3_alias_url url interpolation. See the
    #   link in the +url+ entry for more information about S3 domains and buckets.
    # * +url+: There are three options for the S3 url. You can choose to have the bucket's name
    #   placed domain-style (bucket.s3.amazonaws.com) or path-style (s3.amazonaws.com/bucket).
    #   Lastly, you can specify a CNAME (which requires the CNAME to be specified as
    #   :s3_alias_url. You can read more about CNAMEs and S3 at
    #   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?VirtualHosting.html
    #   Normally, this won't matter in the slightest and you can leave the default (which is
    #   path-style, or :s3_path_url). But in some cases paths don't work and you need to use
    #   the domain-style (:s3_domain_url). Anything else here will be treated like path-style.
    #   NOTE: If you use a CNAME for use with CloudFront, you can NOT specify https as your
    #   :s3_protocol; This is *not supported* by S3/CloudFront. Finally, when using the host
    #   alias, the :bucket parameter is ignored, as the hostname is used as the bucket name
    #   by S3.
    # * +path+: This is the key under the bucket in which the file will be stored. The
    #   URL will be constructed from the bucket and the path. This is what you will want
    #   to interpolate. Keys should be unique, like filenames, and despite the fact that
    #   S3 (strictly speaking) does not support directories, you can still use a / to
    #   separate parts of your file name.
