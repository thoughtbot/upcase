Envjs make use the awesome project 'http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/'
which generates an HTML5 compliant parsing engine, written in Java, into
javascript via GWT.

The generated files are available in 
    env-js/
        src/
            parser/
                html5.js  
                html5.min.js
                html5.detailed.js
                
The various versions are simply generated with varying verbosity of source.
html.js is the most readable at 60KB, html.detailed.js is almost too verbose at 
over 120KB, and finally html5.min.js is totally unreadable but weighs in at only
30KB.  By default the html5.min.js is included in Envjs releases because most
folks aren't too worried about the gory details of the parser. 

The scripts in this folder can be used to checkout and download the various
components you will need to generate these yourself.

Once generated, there are a couple very small and specific changes that must be
made by hand to allow the parser to be initialized with the usual GWT hooks.

You will need to download the appropiate gwt for your platform

http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/files/gwt-windows-1.5.1.zip

Our scripts expect that it will be available at 
    env-js/
        htmlparser/
