# Learn

Learn is a Rails 4 app running on Ruby 2.1 and deployed to Heroku.

## Development

### Rules of the road

This project is now following Sandi Metz's Rules.

You can read a [description of the rules here](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/50655960596/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers).

All new code should follow these rules. If you make changes in a pre-existing
file that violates these rules you should fix the violations as part of
your work.

### Setup

1. Get the code.

        % git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot/learn.git

2. Setup your environment.

        % bin/setup

3. Follow instructions in .env to configure Stripe.

        % vim .env

4. Start Foreman.

        % foreman start

5. Verify that the app is up and running.

        % open http://localhost:5000

### Testing

You'll need to install phantom.js to run some of the specs.

        brew install phantomjs

### Continuous Integration

CI is hosted with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/thoughtbot/learn). The
build is run automatically whenever any branch is updated on Github.

### Ongoing

* Run test suite before committing to the master branch.

        % rake

* Reset development data as needed.

        % rake dev:prime

* Dump production data into your local db. (Note that you need to drop your
  local database first).

        % rake db:drop
        % heroku pg:pull DATABASE_URL workshops_development -r production

* To test that adding/removing GitHub users works, use the GitHub user
  "cpyteltest".

### Payment Testing

#### Stripe

To test Stripe payments on staging use a fake credit card.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Card</th>
      <th>Number</th>
      <th>Expiration</th>
      <th>CVV</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Visa</td>
      <td>4242424242424242</td>
      <td>Any future date</td>
      <td>Any 3 digits</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### PayPal

To test PayPal payments on staging, use your thoughtbot credit card as the
paypal process is live and not sandboxed. After making your purchase you may
perform a refund through the
[staging admin panel](http://learn-staging.herokuapp.com/admin/purchase).


## Amazon AWS S3

To test integration with AWS S3, set the following environment variables:

    AWS_BUCKET
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Deployment

CircleCI deploys to staging automatically when a build passes on master. Once
your changes have been verified in a browser on staging, you can deploy to
production:

    git push production master
    heroku run rake db:migrate --remote production
    heroku restart --remote production

## Flushing the caches

Topics and videos are cached for 12 hours. If you need to flush them, you can.

Staging:

    heroku run rake heroku:flush_cache -r staging

Production:

    heroku run rake heroku:flush_cache -r production

## Sending email on staging

We override the recipient on staging to be `ENV['EMAIL_RECIPIENTS']` so that no
one else can receive email from the staging server.

We have it set to `learn+staging@thoughtbot.com`, which is a mailing list.
Instead of changing the variable, ask to be put on the mailing list.

To set it:

    heroku config:set EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=gabe@thoughtbot.com,melissa@apprentice.io -r staging

To see what the current recipient is:

    heroku config:get EMAIL_RECIPIENTS -r staging

## Admin Access

1. Register on the [Learn](http://learn.thoughtbot.com/sign_up) site.

2. Update your user.

        % heroku run console -r production
        % user = User.find_by_email('foo@example.com')
        % user.admin = true
        % user.save!
        % exit

3. Access the [general admin panel](http://learn.thoughtbot.com/admin) or
   the [workshop admin panel](http://learn.thoughtbot.com/admin).
